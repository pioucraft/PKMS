# PKMS

If you have a new project, itâ€™s fairly simple to organise the roadmap.

1. long term goals
2. Short term goals: how to implement long term goals
3. How to implement short term goals, which are just instructions for every time tou have your code editor open
4. Make sure that there are enough steps in each of the three categories to keep you coding for some time


## 1. Long term goals
Have a working PKMS with journaling feature too

### PKMS

#### Mindmap
In Markdown, you can create different headers. These basically work like nodes in a mindmap. A h4 is the children of the latest h3 header in the md file. This file is a pretty good example of a md mindmap. I should do it a bit differently, because it's a bit confusing to have to add headers manually, but the idea is there.

#### Files 
You can have folders ofc.
Tracked with my custom VCS.

#### VCS
Use the VCS I created to store the books.

### Journaling
Create journal entries whenever you want.

#### Archiving
You shouldn't delete journal entries. Instead, you should archive them. This way, you can still access them later if you want to. But if you really want to, you can still delete them.

#### Tags
You can create tags for your journal entries.
When you create a new journal entry, the last 3 tags will be displayed, and if you want, you can quickly add them to the entry. You can always add other tags.
You can sort journal entries by tags
